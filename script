# Driver Files

Place your Ricoh printer driver files in this directory structure:

```
drivers/
└── disk1/
    ├── oemsetup.inf
    ├── [driver files...]
    └── [additional folders...]
```

## How to get drivers:

1. Visit [Ricoh Support](https://www.ricoh.com/support)
2. Search for your printer model (e.g., "M C251FW")
3. Download the PCL6 or PostScript driver package
4. Extract the downloaded file
5. Copy the contents of the extracted driver folder to `drivers/disk1/`

## Important Notes:

- The `oemsetup.inf` file must be present in the `disk1` folder
- Driver files are excluded from git commits due to size
- Each user must obtain their own driver files from Ricoh
```
